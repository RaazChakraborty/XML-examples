1.computer  system architecture 
    a)Multi processor system.(it contains #registers and # cache)
        task will devided into sevaral pieces.
        it also called tightly coupled and parallel  system.
         exmple: int a;
                 a=10 a not equal to 10.33 or else.
         Multiprocessor share memory.
        Computer's memory is ram.
     Benifit:
           economy of scale.Time of execution reduced.more realiable.increased output.
     There are two type of multiprocessor.
  1.Asymmective Multiproccessor.
  2.Symmectric  multiprocessor.
Dual Core.
     b)Cluster System.(Losely Coupled as it havbe no mandatory rules)
     it will have their own memory and periferals,
      but they basically share memory.Sharing memory called "SAN"
  Computer System Operation
1)MultiProgramming.(Batch System).
2)Multitasking(Time Sharing).

*I/O operation occurs for interupt
Job scheduling=multiprogramming.
 Multitasking=cpu schudule
time sharing responce will be less then 1sec.
Dual Mode Operation.
1)User mode
2)Kernel mode
user mode in safer and kernel mode is priviledged.
trap =software interapt.   
 process managment
file managment.
memory management.
 System Call=
API=application Programming Interface
